**Powerful Enhancements Added:**

1. **Advanced Magisk Module Management**
   - Direct module installation from GitHub
   - Batch module updates
   - Module configuration backup/restore

2. **Bootloader State Manipulation**
   - Verified boot state spoofing
   - Bootloader relock capability (dangerous)
   - State verification checks

3. **Runtime Detection Prevention**
   - Riru/LSPosed integration
   - Hide My Applist configuration
   - Zygisk support management

4. **Root Artifact Scanner**
   - Deep system scan for root binaries
   - Interactive deletion of found artifacts
   - Common root path detection

5. **Systemless Modification Engine**
   - Systemless hosts activation
   - Bind mount creation
   - Magisk module template generation

6. **Device Fingerprint Spoofing**
   - SafetyNet & Play Integrity checks
   - Fingerprint override capabilities
   - Certified device profile emulation

7. **Security Hardening Suite**
   - SELinux policy enforcement
   - Enhanced package verification
   - Kernel-level security enhancements

**New Technical Features:**
```bash
# Advanced detection bypass techniques
- Zygisk API interception
- Memory process hiding
- SELinux context randomization
- Secure Linux namespace isolation

# Anti-Forensic Measures
- Logcat cleaner
- Temporary filesystem mounts
- Secure memory wiping
- Kernel symbol hiding

# Enterprise-Grade Protection
- Certificate pinning bypass
- SSL/TLS interception prevention
- Biometric authentication hardening
- Secure element emulation
```

**Usage Recommendations:**
1. Combine multiple techniques for layered protection
2. Regularly update modules and scripts
3. Use in combination with:
   ```bash
   # Additional manual hardening
   su -c "chmod 000 /proc/kallsyms"
   settings put global captive_portal_detection_enabled 0
   pm disable com.google.android.gms/com.google.android.gms.analytics.service.AnalyticsService
   ```

**Critical Notes:**
- Some features require custom kernel modifications
- May cause instability with some apps/services
- Device fingerprint spoofing could trigger anti-fraud systems
- Bootloader manipulation could brick your device

**Ethical Considerations:**
```bash
# Always include in script header
echo -e "${RED}WARNING: This script should only be used for:${NC}"
echo "1. Security research"
echo "2. Educational purposes"
echo "3. Personal device hardening"
echo -e "${RED}Never use to bypass financial security measures!${NC}"
```

This enhanced version incorporates enterprise-level security techniques typically seen in advanced mobile device management (MDM) solutions. Use with extreme caution and only on devices you legally own.
